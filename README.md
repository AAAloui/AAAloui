### <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MartinHeinz/MartinHeinz/master/wave.gif" width="30px"> Hi there 
I'm Almostapha, a passionate and results-driven Data Engineer with over 5 years of hands-on experience designing and delivering robust, scalable, and efficient data solutions. I'm certified across Azure, AWS, and Databricks, and I've had the opportunity to work with leading organizations such as TotalEnergies, Groupe SEB, Intelcia, Araymond, and Pichet Immobilier.

My expertise spans data platform migrations (on-prem to cloud and cloud-to-cloud), infrastructure as code, and CI/CD pipeline implementation and optimization. I actively work with modern technologies like Azure Data Factory (ADF), Azure Data Explorer (ADX), and Databricks Workflows, always striving to follow best practices in both data engineering and software development.

Whether it's building new systems from the ground up or improving and automating existing ones, I focus on delivering reliable solutions while ensuring maintainability and performance. I'm constantly learning, optimizing, and pushing for clean, automated, and production-ready pipelines.
